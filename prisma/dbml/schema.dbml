  Note: 'User could be a student, college staff or internal admin or super user
All constraints like unique, required, etc are defined at the app level.
One college user can only be associated with one college (institution).
When the user changes colleges or moves on to a new college, they get a new id.
Their personal details (name, email, etc) can remain the same but
a new id is generated for them.
rollNumber - Roll Number provided by the college. This is the primary means
of identifying the user from a college\'s perspective. This also means
that the same person can have multiple accounts in different colleges.
This is not mandatory at the database level since other user types
(like super users, internal admins, etc) can have a null roll number.
collegeId  - College id that the user is studying in. This is the primary means of
identifying the user from a college\'s perspective. Also, this field is
not mandatory at the database level since other types of users can have
a null college id.
email      - The email address or the phone number of the user need not be unique.
This is useful in case the email is associated with multiple colleges.
of if the user changes from one college to another.
fname      - First name of the user.
lname      - Last name of the user.
fullName   - Colleges might not always have a first name and last name.
We will allow the colleges to upload the user in any of the following formats.
1. FirstName LastName (as two separate columns in an excel)
2. Full name (as one column in an excel)
Once created, the user or the college can later update the user\'s name manually.
or update the first name last name back from the user name.
avatar     - The user can upload an avatar image. It is stored in S3 as a public url and
stored in this field.'
